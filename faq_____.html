        <h3>Tell me about yourself.</h3>
        <p>
            I am a problem solver. I improve business by providing solution to problem.
        </p>
        <h3>Are you currently working?</h3>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <h3>What are your strengths?</h3>
        <p>
            I had the opportunities to work in various positions for big and small companies, spanning several
            industries. My experience in solving various problems allow me to solve bigger and
            more challenging problems in better ways.
        </p>
        <h3>What are your weaknesses?</h3>
        <p>
            I always look for greater problems to solve. If there are no greater problems to solve, I might leave the
            job.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why do you want to change your job?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I am always looking to join great companies with smart people who pride themselves in building great
            products. I must get out of my comfort zone to grow professionally.
        </p>
        <h3>What is your expected salary?</h3>
        <p>
            I can't tell because every position is different. We can discuss about compensation when there is a
            presented offer.
        </p>
        <h3>How soon can you start working?</h3>
        <p>I need two weeks notice to transfer all of my current knowledge.</p>
